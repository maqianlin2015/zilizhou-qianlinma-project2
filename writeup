•	What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

We found it’s challenge for beginners start to code the game from scratch without stater code provided. 
It is challenging and use React when not get familiar with JavaScript enough, and meanwhile to meet the 
requirements on the assignment to use state management. Thinking about what components we will need and, 
all the game logics and code them out are very challenging. 

•	Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

Given more time, we would like to add features such as recording how many steps the player takes to hit 
all the ships per round, and give the player a view based on the rank of the fewest steps taken for all 
the rounds of games the player has played. 

•	What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
We made assumptions that the player can click and drag the boat on their own (which is a bonus point that 
we write it in our code eventually), or they can place it randomly, horizontally/vertically. We also assume 
that the we will have a local storage to store the state of the game after every action (which is another bonus 
point we worked on). In addition, when the human player plays with AI player, the AI move can be either smart or not.

•	How long did this assignment take to complete?
20hrs and plus.
